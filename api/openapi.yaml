When you remove an entry from the IP access list, existing connections from the removed address or addresses may remain open for a variable amount of time. The amount of time it takes MongoDB Cloud to close the connection depends upon several factors, including:

          - how your application established the connection,

          Required parameters depend on whether someone has enabled Encryption at Rest using Customer Key Management:

          If you have enabled Encryption at Rest using Customer Key Management (CMK), Atlas requires all of the parameters for the desired encryption provider.

          - To use AWS Key Management Service (KMS), MongoDB Cloud requires all the fields in the **awsKms** object.
          - To use Azure Key Vault, MongoDB Cloud requires all the fields in the **azureKeyVault** object.
          - To use Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS), MongoDB Cloud requires all the fields in the **googleCloudKms** object.

          If you enabled Encryption at Rest using Customer Key  Management, administrators can pass only the changed fields for the **awsKms**, **azureKeyVault**, or **googleCloudKms** object to update the configuration to this endpoint.

        Hardware specifications for nodes set for a given region. Each **regionConfigs** object describes the region's priority in elections and the number and type of MongoDB nodes that MongoDB Cloud deploys to the region. Each **regionConfigs** object must have either an **analyticsSpecs** object, **electableSpecs** object, or **readOnlySpecs** object. Tenant clusters only require **electableSpecs. Dedicated** clusters can specify any of these specifications, but must have at least one **electableSpecs** object within a **replicationSpec**. Every hardware specification must use the same **instanceSize**.

        **Example:**

        If you set `\"replicationSpecs[n].regionConfigs[m].analyticsSpecs.instanceSize\" : \"M30\"`, set `\"replicationSpecs[n].regionConfigs[m].electableSpecs.instanceSize\" : `\"M30\"` if you have electable nodes and `\"replicationSpecs[n].regionConfigs[m].readOnlySpecs.instanceSize\" : `\"M30\"` if you have read-only nodes.",

            Specific pre-defined method chosen to convert database field text into searchable words. This conversion reduces the text of fields into the smallest units of text. These units are called a **term** or **token**. This process, known as tokenization, involves a variety of changes made to the text in fields:

            - extracting words
            - removing punctuation
            - removing accents
            - changing to lowercase
            - removing common words
            - reducing words to their root form (stemming)
            - changing words to their base form (lemmatization)
             MongoDB Cloud uses the selected process to build the Atlas Search index.

            - Set this value to `true` to enable regionalized private endpoints. This allows you to create more than one private endpoint in a cloud provider region. You need to enable this setting to connect to multi-region and global MongoDB Cloud sharded clusters. Enabling regionalized private endpoints introduces the following limitations:
              - Your applications must use the new connection strings for existing multi-region and global sharded clusters. This might cause downtime.
              - Your MongoDB Cloud project can't contain replica sets nor can you create new replica sets in this project.

              - You can't disable this setting if you have:
                - more than one private endpoint in more than one region
                - more than one private endpoint in one region and one private endpoint in one or more regions.

            - Set this value to `false` to disable regionalized private endpoints.

            IP addresses expressed in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation that MongoDB Cloud uses for the network peering containers in your project. MongoDB Cloud assigns all of the project's clusters deployed to this cloud provider an IP address from this range. MongoDB Cloud locks this value if an M10 or greater cluster or a network peering connection exists in this project.

            These CIDR blocks must fall within the ranges reserved per RFC 1918. AWS and Azure further limit the block to between the `/24` and  `/21` ranges.

            To modify the CIDR block, the target project cannot have:

            - Any M10 or greater clusters
            - Any other VPC peering connections

             You can also create a new project and create a network peering connection to set the desired MongoDB Cloud network peering container CIDR block for that project. MongoDB Cloud limits the number of MongoDB nodes per network peering connection based on the CIDR block and the region selected for the project.

             **Example:** A project in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) region supporting three availability zones and an MongoDB CIDR network peering container block of limit of `/24` equals 27 three-node replica sets.

            IP addresses expressed in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation that MongoDB Cloud uses for the network peering containers in your project. MongoDB Cloud assigns all of the project's clusters deployed to this cloud provider an IP address from this range. MongoDB Cloud locks this value if an M10 or greater cluster or a network peering connection exists in this project.

            These CIDR blocks must fall within the ranges reserved per RFC 1918. AWS and Azure further limit the block to between the `/24` and  `/21` ranges.

            To modify the CIDR block, the target project cannot have:

            - Any M10 or greater clusters
            - Any other VPC peering connections

             You can also create a new project and create a network peering connection to set the desired MongoDB Cloud network peering container CIDR block for that project. MongoDB Cloud limits the number of MongoDB nodes per network peering connection based on the CIDR block and the region selected for the project.

             **Example:** A project in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) region supporting three availability zones and an MongoDB CIDR network peering container block of limit of `/24` equals 27 three-node replica sets.

            IP addresses expressed in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation that MongoDB Cloud uses for the network peering containers in your project. MongoDB Cloud assigns all of the project's clusters deployed to this cloud provider an IP address from this range. MongoDB Cloud locks this value if an M10 or greater cluster or a network peering connection exists in this project.

            These CIDR blocks must fall within the ranges reserved per RFC 1918. GCP further limits the block to a lower bound of the `/18` range.

            To modify the CIDR block, the target project cannot have:

            - Any M10 or greater clusters
            - Any other VPC peering connections

             You can also create a new project and create a network peering connection to set the desired MongoDB Cloud network peering container CIDR block for that project. MongoDB Cloud limits the number of MongoDB nodes per network peering connection based on the CIDR block and the region selected for the project.

             **Example:** A project in an Google Cloud (GCP) region supporting three availability zones and an MongoDB CIDR network peering container block of limit of `/24` equals 27 three-node replica sets.
